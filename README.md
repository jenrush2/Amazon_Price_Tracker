## Amazon Price Tracker

This program is based on the tutorial at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bg9r_yLk7VY. 

This scrapes an amazon website to look for price drops, then sends an email to notify me that the price has dropped. 

Use pip install -r requirements.txt to install the required packages. 

Repace URL, email addresses, and go through two-step-verification to generate your own password, then input that in line 44. Replace email addresses on lines 44, 53, and 54.
